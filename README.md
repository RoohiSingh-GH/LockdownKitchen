# LockdownKitchen
 
This project idea emerged from the current situation the world is facing due to COVID-19. The name of our project is LOCKDOWN KITCHEN. 
“As a kitchen is a place where memories are cooked and seasoned with love”, a healthy diet is essential for a healthy immune system. 
Since the present scenario helped people to bring out the hidden talent where cooking is one of them, we thought of designing a web application project where:
1. People would get the platform to add their delicious cooking recipes with ultimate images and share them globally.
2. Keep a count of their calories in their cooked recipes.
3. They get the opportunity to shop online the ingredients needed in their recipes.
