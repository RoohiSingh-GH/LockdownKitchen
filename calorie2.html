<H1>Low-Calorie Foods That Are Surprisingly Filling</H1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">

One of the most challenging aspects of weight loss is cutting back on calories.

Many low-calorie foods can leave you feeling hungry and unfulfilled between meals, making it much more tempting to overeat and indulge.

Fortunately, plenty of healthy foods exist that are both filling and low in calories.

Here are some low-calorie foods that are surprisingly filling.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px;">Oats can be an excellent addition to a healthy weight loss diet.

They are not only low in calories but also high in protein and fiber that keep you feeling full.

A 1/2-cup (40-gram) serving of dry oats has just 148 calories but packs 5.5 grams of protein and 3.8 grams of fiber both of which can have a significant impact on your hunger and appetite.

One study in 48 adults demonstrated that eating oatmeal increased feelings of fullness and reduced hunger and calorie intake at the next meal.

Another small study linked instant and old-fashioned oatmeal to significantly improved appetite control over a four-hour period compared to a ready-to-eat breakfast cereal.</p>

Eggs are extremely nutrient-dense, as they’re low in calories but rich in many vital nutrients.

A single large egg has approximately 72 calories, 6 grams of protein and a wide array of important vitamins and minerals (14).

Studies suggest that starting your day with a serving of eggs can reduce hunger and boost fullness.

In a study in 30 women, those who ate eggs for breakfast instead of a bagel experienced greater feelings of fullness and consumed 105 fewer calories later in the day (15Trusted Source).

Other studies observe that a high-protein breakfast could decrease snacking, slow the emptying of your stomach and reduce levels of ghrelin, the hormone responsible for hunger

Often hailed as a serious superfood, chia seeds pack a high amount of protein and fiber into a low number of calories.

A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of chia seeds provides 137 calories, 4.4 grams of protein and a whopping 10.6 grams of fiber.

Chia seeds are especially high in soluble fiber, a type of fiber that absorbs liquid and swells in your stomach to promote feelings of fullness.

In fact, some research observes that chia seeds can absorb 10–12 times their weight in water, moving slowly through your digestive tract to keep you feeling full.

Adding a serving or two of chia seeds to your daily diet can curb cravings and reduce appetite.

In one study in 24 adults, those who consumed yogurt with added chia seeds reported decreased hunger, less desire for sugary foods and enhanced feelings of fullness compared to the control group</p>

Watermelon has a high water content to keep you hydrated and full while supplying a minimal number of calories.

One cup (152 grams) of diced watermelon contains 46 calories alongside an assortment of essential micronutrients like vitamins A and C.

Eating foods with a low calorie density, such as watermelon, has been shown to have similar effects on feelings of fullness and hunger compared to high-calorie-density foods (45Trusted Source.

Plus, foods with a lower calorie density have been linked to lower body weight and decreased calorie intake.

In fact, in one study in 49 women, replacing oat cookies with an equal number of calories from fruit significantly reduced calorie intake and body weight.
